## Notes for _A Data Transformation Problem Solved in T-SQL and Functional Programming_

The ice_cream.sql file has all the T-SQL code that appears in _Part I: Problem Space, SQL Server Simulation and Analysis_.  Developed on a local copy of SQL Server 2019, it runs in either Azure Data Studio or SSMS.  Use it to create and populate the Ice Cream database, run the queries and view the execution plans.

The IceCream_test.scala file has all the Scala code for _Part II: Equivalent Solutions in Functional Programming_.  You can view it in Notepad (or an IDE such as Intellij, where I developed it.)  The .jar file can be run in PowerShell if you have Java and Scala set up in Windows 10.  The .jar expects <PATH TO FILE>\icecream_rows.csv as args(0).
