## Notes for _A Data Transformation Problem Solved in T-SQL and Functional Programming_

The ice_cream.sql file is all the T-SQL code that appears in 'Part I: Problem Space, SQL Server Simulation and Analysis.'  Developed on a local copy of SQL Server 2019, it runs in either Azure Data Studio or SSMS.  Use it to create and populate the Ice Cream database, run the queries and view the execution plans.

The IceCream_test.scala file has all the Scala code for 'Part II: Equivalent Solutions in Functional Programming.'  You can view/run it in a text editor or IDE.  The operating system file used to populate the Scala project, icecream_rows.csv, has the same data as ice_cream.sql.
